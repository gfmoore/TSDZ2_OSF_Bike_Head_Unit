# TSDZ2 Bike Head Unit
## For the Tongshen TSDZ2 mid motor Open Source Firmware project 

### Written in React_Native

This is an attempt to create an Android iOS head unit on a mobile phone for controlling the Tongshen TSDZ2 bicycle motor created by Casainho, mspider66 mbrusa et al on The Endless Sphere webite.

It is written using React-Native.
This is my first time using this environment so it may be badly structured as it is a learning experience, though hopefully useful.

It is anticipated that the motor will be connected to a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module and will be able to communicate with the motor.

I hope to create a nice graphical UI as a front end, but a copy of what Casainho did for 850c and 860c displays will probably be included.

It would also be nice to be able to flash updated firmware to the motor through the app. I have no idea if that is possible. I know Casainho has done it with his nRF52840 bluetooth module.

Oh well, development now ...

Gordon.
